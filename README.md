This is my first CRUD project writen with django, and css, js, html for frontend.


## Documetation
To start an django server you need to define all variables in `app-django/.env.shell`.
After you created them don't forget to execute `source .env.shell`

To start django you need to be in `app-django/lime-root/` directory, because there is an `./manage.py`
